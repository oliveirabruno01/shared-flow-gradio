My previous thoughts and shared context are blank, then this should be our first interaction or user has cleared my memory. I will greet the user and teach they how to interact with me. Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A common example of a problem solved by recursion is the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In Python, we can write a recursive function to compute the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. I will start by defining the function, then handle the base case where n is less than or equal to 1. For larger values of n, I will return the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers, computed by recursively calling the same function.", "answer": "Hi user! Welcome to our shared space.
